We want to select all unique values in a column, Use unique to view an array of all unique values in a column, Alternatively, value_counts will display all unique values with the number of times each value appears
Both unique and value_counts are useful for manipulating and exploring categorical columns. Very often in categorical columns there will be classes that need to be handled in the data wrangling phase.
For example, in the Titanic dataset, PClass is a column indicating the class of a passenger’s ticket, There were three classes on the Titanic; however, if we use value_counts we can see a problem.
While almost all passengers belong to one of three classes as expected, a single passenger has the class  There are a number of strategies for handling this type of issue but for now just realize that “extra” classes are common in categorical data and should not be ignored.
